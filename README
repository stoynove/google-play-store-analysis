What we used:
- Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types


What we did:



Interesting findings:
 - The apps with the most duplicates are (9) ROBLOX, (8) CBS Sports App - Scores, News, Stats & Watch Live , Candy Crush Saga, (7) 8 Ball Pool, 
   Duolingo: Learn Languages Free , ESPN , (6)slither.io , Sniper 3D Gun Shooter: Free Shooting Games - FPS, Subway Surfers, Temple Run 2, Zombie Catchers, Helix Jump,
   Nick, Bleacher Report: sports news, scores, & highlights, Bowmasters.
      Most of these apps are game-related so it's possible the web scraper picked them up the most because they are from other sections of the play store like the game section.

What we can still do:
 - Run a regression to predict the values of ratings. We can also measure our accuracy by taking the ratings we already know and splitting that into a training and test set
